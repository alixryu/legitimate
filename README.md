Welcome to Oberlin College Computer Science Department's Git Night Fall 2015

## Event Outline

### Git History
* creator: Linus Torvalds

* diff vs snapshot

### Git Basics (getting started)
* first-time git setup

* branching (branch, checkout)
* merging (merge)
* viewing git logs (log)


### Sociable Git (using git with multiple people on a remote repository)
* remote repositories (remote, push, pull, fetch)
* workflows (master, develop)
* rebasing (rebase)
* merge vs rebase

### GitHub (becoming even more sociable)
